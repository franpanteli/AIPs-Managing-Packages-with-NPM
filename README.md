# Managing Packages With npm

The repository contains my independent work for the first exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called Managing Packages with NPM, and involved writing the package.json file for a project in its Gitpod environment. My notes on this section of the course are detailed in the pdf in this repository called [Managing Packages with NPM Course Notes.pdf](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Managing-Packages-with-NPM/blob/main/Managing%20Packages%20with%20NPM%20Course%20Notes.pdf).
