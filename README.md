# Managing Packages With NPM

This repository contains my independent work for the first exercise in freeCodeCamp's [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) course. This section of the course was called "Managing Packages with NPM", where I solved 10 NPM challenges by writing [the package.json file for a project](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Managing-Packages-with-NPM/blob/main/package.json) in a Gitpod environment. My notes on the material from this section of the course are contained in [the pdf file in this repository.](https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-Managing-Packages-with-NPM/blob/main/Managing%20Packages%20with%20NPM%20Course%20Notes.pdf) These are in-depth and cover the following topics with NPM:
<ul>
  <li>How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package</li>
  <li>Add a Description to Your package.json</li>
  <li>Add Keywords to Your package.json</li>
  <li>Add a License to Your package.json</li>
  <li>Add a Version to Your package.json</li>
  <li>Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm</li>
  <li>Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning</li>
  <li>Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency</li>
  <li>Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency</li>
  <li>Remove a Package from Your Dependencies</li>
</ul>
